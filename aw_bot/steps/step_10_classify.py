"""Step 10 -- read the screen the wizard stopped on and classify the lead.

It exists to answer the question the whole run is for: is this lead a sale, a
document request, or someone who already has the benefit elsewhere.

It presses Continue on the screens that state no decision -- currently the
account review, which reads the applicant's own details back at them. Those
are pages between verdicts rather than verdicts, and classifying one would
record an outcome the site never gave. Everything else it only reads.

Worth being explicit about what that Continue does on the review screen: it
consents to Assurance Wireless pre-populating a California LifeLine
application with the details collected so far. That is a step beyond gathering
Assurance Wireless's own information, and it is clicked because this run is
meant to reach the eligibility decision, which sits behind it.

It is also how the rest of the wizard gets mapped. Whatever screen the step
before it lands on, this records the headings, fields and buttons into the run's
artifacts, so a screen that is not yet recognised comes back as `unknown` with
everything needed to add it to `classify.py` -- rather than a guessed verdict.

The wizard's own rail is PERSONAL INFO -> ELIGIBILITY -> PHONE OPTIONS ->
DISCLOSURES -> SUBMIT PROOF, so there are screens still to map between the
address screen and the one that states a decision. Each run that ends `unknown`
here is what tells us the next one to implement.
